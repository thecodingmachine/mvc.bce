#About BCE
##Purpose

<p>
BCE is a form builder for the Mouf framework. Its main goal is making your life easier. It will handle the main aspects of an HTML form:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the form</li>
<li>Perform client and server side validation</li>
<li>Persist data into the database</li>
</ul>

<p>Design choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Quick and Easy</b> BCE provides an advanced form configuration interface that will automatically suggest form fields, and their attributes. In a few words, creating a basic form (including validation and persistance) may take you less than 5 minute!</li>
<li><b>Customizing is simple</b> Because specific needs will always come up, you may code your custom field and use it in your form quite simply. Of course, you are very welcome to contribute and provide BCE with new field types. For instance, we are looking for a color picker field, anyone interested ?</li>
</ul>
